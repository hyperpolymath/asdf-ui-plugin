== Pending Specification

The following will be defined once project specification is uploaded:

* [ ] Target UI tool/framework to be managed
* [ ] Version resolution strategy
* [ ] Platform support matrix (Linux, macOS, Windows)
* [ ] Binary vs source installation approach

== Planned Milestones

=== Phase 1: Foundation
_Timeline: After specification upload_

* [ ] Define target tool and version sources
* [ ] Implement `bin/list-all` - list available versions
* [ ] Implement `bin/download` - download specific version
* [ ] Implement `bin/install` - install downloaded version

=== Phase 2: Core Plugin

* [ ] Implement `bin/list-bin-paths` - expose binaries
* [ ] Add version verification (checksums)
* [ ] Platform detection and binary selection
* [ ] Basic test suite

=== Phase 3: Polish

* [ ] Add `bin/latest-stable` for convenience
* [ ] Legacy version support (if applicable)
* [ ] CI testing across platforms
* [ ] Documentation and examples

=== Phase 4: Release

* [ ] Submit to asdf plugin registry
* [ ] Publish v1.0.0 release
* [ ] Announce availability

== Architecture (Tentative)
